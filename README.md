# Question-Answering-Task-using-T5-Model
Question Answering (QA) system using the T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer) base model

**Overview**

This notebook implements a Question Answering (QA) system using the T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer) model. 

The system is trained on a dataset to extract answers from a given context and is evaluated based on metrics like Exact Match (EM) and F1 Score.

- Utilizes the T5 base model for extractive QA.

- Evaluates validation set performance using Exact Match (EM) and F1 Score.

- Implements early stopping to prevent overfitting.

- Generates predicted answers for a test set.
